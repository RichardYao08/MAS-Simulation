% The task of this script is to measure the properties of the communication
% channel provided by the SINR networking library. While the basics of the
% transmission are known, there is no intuition for the size and shape of
% the communication discs as well as the effect of the transmission power
% on these.
% Thus, we perform a Monte-Carlo like simulation to estimate the size of
% the communication discs.

% Configure the network with the desired properties. We only have two
% agents, of which only one will send messages, so one slot is sufficient.
% The main tuning knobs for the first figure are the transmission power and
% the path loss.

%% Sweep over distance
% The first figure we are interested in is an estimate of the reception
% probability for different distances between the agents. Therefore, we
% perform a sweep over the distance and send a number of messages over the
% network to estimate the probability.

%% Sweep over power
% The second plot should show us the distance at which a certain reception
% probability is barely reached depending on the transmission power. For
% this, we perform a logarithmic sweep over a range of transmission powers.
%
% The search algorithm is then split into two phases. First, we search for
% an upper bound by exponentially increasing the distance between the
% sender and receiver for a given power until the desired reception
% probability is no longer reached. Afterwards, we apply a repeated
% bisection to calculate the desired distance to a given error threshold.
%
% In both phases, we transmit a number of messages over the channel to
% estimate the reception probability.

    %   number of messages that were received.
